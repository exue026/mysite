# About

Hi, my name is Ethan! I'm a second year Sofware Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I've worked with languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, Go, C++, and Swift, and web technologies like React, Redux, Node, Django in professional settings, on the side, and in school.

I consider myself a Lifelong Learner. Versatility and adaptability are two software engineering qualities that I particularly value and strive to improve on --that's why I'm always hungry to get my hands dirty with new technologies. With tech being such a large and fast growing industry, there's just so many more areas I have yet to explore. The journey of learning never ceases.

<strong>I'm currently looking for internship opportunities for the Summer 2019 term (May - August), so feel free to [email](mailto: ethan.xue@gmail.com) me if you're interested in talking.</strong>

# Experience

## eero inc. - Software Engineering Intern

I'm currently interning on the Growth team at eero. I'll be doing full-stack development on the Remote Network Management application, using technologies like React/Redux and Scala. I hope to also learn some DevOps involving AWS and Kubernetes.

## Zenreach - Full-Stack Engineering Intern

 I worked at [Zenreach](http://zenreach.com){:target="_blank"}. Zenreach is a late-stage startup headquarted in California that provides Wifi marketing solutions for approximately 7000 businesses. Recently, they managed to raise $30 million in Series C funding, including contributions from NBA all-star Kevin Durant and actor/VC Ashton Kutcher.

Main technologies I used:
* JavaScript, Python, Go
* React, Redux, Sass, Django
* Kafka, Celery
* MongoDB
* Split.io, Prometheus, Goa

What I accomplished:
* Contact-list, a feature allowing a business to manage and analyze their customers.
    * Incorporated Redux, fixing numerous pre-exisiting bugs and reducing the size of the codebase significantly.
    * Completely refactored the UI/UX of the feature, making it much more user friendly and valuable for clients.
    * Implemented complex custom filtering and asynchronous bulk actions like bulk updating customer information and bulk undoing imported customers using Celery.
    * Performed A/B tests using split.io, which told us that the revamped contact-list increased user engagement by 40-50%.
* Unbundling the main product
    * Setup Go service using Goa and exposed metrics endpoints to Prometheus for the sake of load testing the service
    * Integrated a store interface that pulls billing data from Postgres
    * Implemented in-memory LRU caching and core logic for turning on and turning off various product addons using billing information, business tree hierachies, and gatekeeper data from Mongo.
* Event-driven smart messages
    * Implemented Go microservice that makes smart-message email sending event-driven by using Apache Kafka, resulting in a 15x increase in speed compared to the existing system
    * Reduced worst case time from hours to minutes

## Zeitspace Inc. - Software-Engineering Intern

I worked at [Zeitspace Inc.](http://zeitspace.com){:target="_blank"}, a recently-established product design and development consulting agency in downtown Kitchener. I was involved in the development and productionalization of two products, both with thousands of users.

Main technologies I used:
* JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin
* React, CSS, Node
* PostgreSQL, Heroku

What I accomplished:
* iOS and Android real-time news applications
    * Pioneered iOS and Android applications for the YMCA that delivered real-time updates and photos to the families of 6000+ children.
    * The iOS app had 90+ daily users at its peak, and 50+ for the Android app.
    * Contributed to the backend Node server supporting both mobile platforms
    * I implemented my own algorithm to efficiently aggregate user data in a background task and optimized SQL queries for Postgres, together which ultimately led to a boost in performance of data processing and delivery by 750%
* Web application for the SHORE centre
    * Implemented a RESTful web application using by React, Node, and PostgreSQL, featuring a JavaScript survey framework that generates dynamic surveys for web apps, which I contributed to building from scratch.
* Other
    * I developed and presented a 2+ hour hands-on technical workshop on Kotlin to 20+ industry professionals as an event on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Zeitspace/events/242825767/)

Hi my name is Ethan Xue! I'm a second year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I built this website mainly because I wanted to try out blogging, so head over to my [blog](/index) if you'd like, or keep on reading to learn some more interesting (or uninteresting) things about me.

I have industry experience in mobile development, primarily doing iOS, and web development. Some of the programming languages I've used in projects include Java, C++, JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin, Scala and I'm currently learning Python.

Being enrolled in the co-op program at UW, I've completed one term of work already and I'm currently in my second work term. I worked at [Zeitspace Inc.](http://zeitspace.com){:target="_blank"} for my first coop as a Software Engineer; they're a recently-established product design and development consulting agency in downtown Kitchener. I was put in charge of an iOS application for the local YMCA, in which I single-handedly completed, participating in all parts of the software production cycle, from design to development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. I implemented the Android version of the application thereafter, using the new Kotlin programming language. The iOS app had a 90+ daily users at its peak, and 50+ for the Android app. I also worked in a team in an Agile setting to build a RESTful web application powered by ReactJS, NodeJS, and PostgreSQL for SHORE Centre, which featured a JavaScript survey framework which I contributed to implementing from scratch.

Currently, I'm working as a Full-Stack Engineer at [Zenreach](http://zenreach.com){:target="_blank"}, which is also located in downtown Kitchener. Zenreach is a late-stage startup heardquarted in California that provide a Wifi marketing product for businesses of all kinds. Recently, they managed to raise $30 million in Series C funding, including contributions from NBA all-star Kevin Durant and actor/VC Ashton Kutcher. I'll be getting my hands dirty with ReactJS in the frontend, and Python and/or Golang in the backend, along with MongoDB.

I was born and raised in Burnaby, B.C. before deciding to come study Sofware Engineering at UW. My hobbies include swimming, basketball, coding, travelling, hiking, weight-lifting, and video games.

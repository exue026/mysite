There are a number of reasons why I decided to create this blog. Here are three main ones:

1) I want to improve my writing skills. Being in Software Engineering, a logic and arithmetic heavy program, I never really have the opportunity to refine my expertise in the areas of fine arts and literature. From as long as I can remember, I've never had an interest in those subjects. Not only did I find writing to be boring, but I never felt like I was actually "good" at it. Specifically, I am a slow writer, and coming up with ideas on what to write about has always been nothing short but difficult. I would often spend 20-30 minutes grinding out a single sentence.

2) I want to share what I have learned with others.

3) I hope that blogging will allow me to reflect on my experiences and accomplishments, and to further myself accordingly.

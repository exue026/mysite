My two cents on whether or not you should attend a hackathon.
....

How to be a good teammate at a Hackathon:

* Know your basic git commands like `git clone <name of repo>`,  `git pull`, `git status`, `git add -A`, `git commit -m "<your message>"`, `git diff`, `git branch`, `git checkout <branch name>`, etc.
* Don't ditch your teammates halfway through the Hackathon
* Ask lots of questions when you're confused or need clarification

I was inspired by some youtube videos the other day to create a "day in the life video." I spent one day taking the video clips and about a week editing them. The process took so long because I never did any kind of video editing before, so it took some time to get familiar with iMovie's user interface. I also wanted to make sure it was top quality (in my standards), since it was going to be the first video I uploaded on YouTube. Here is the link to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKSSWMwIivY&t=4s){:target="_blank"}. I hope you guys like it. Also, please leave a comment on this page using Disqus. I would love to hear your feedback!

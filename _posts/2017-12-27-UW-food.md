It's Christmas break and I have nothing better to talk about, so let's talk about food. I've lived in the V1 residence for 8 months, so I can comment on campus/cafe food, and I've always been a regular visitor to our UW plaza, I can provide my two cents on plaza food too. In addition, I lived beside Laurier for 4 months in the summer of 2017 so I can add some additional info on the restaurants there.

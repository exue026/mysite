As just your average kid who grew up in Vancity, I had pretty decent Canadian schools nearby like SFU and UBC, both of which are ranked top 10 in the nation, so why did I decide to take my (non-existing) talents to the University of Waterloo, an institution basically located in the middle of nowhere?? There's a long story to it.

Before grade 12, I barely knew about Waterloo. I vaguely remember having a conversation about Canadian Universities with my parents when I was small. I recall sitting on the couch in our old apartment one evening, while my parents were reading the newspaper. Specifically, they were analyzing an article about the top ranking schools in Canada. That's when I learned about McGill, which was listed as first place in that article, as well as other schools like Queens and UBC. I remember my mom saying that UBC was very hard to be accepted into, had a good medical school, and was near our city. I don't remember the exact details after that, but ever since then I somehow attained the belief that UBC was "the school" I was going to attend, I was going to be a doctor, and the road wouldn't be easy. Funny enough, looking back many years later, UBC is not "the school" I'm currently at, and I am not planning to be a doctor, but what did turn out to be true is that the road has not, and will not be easy.

I first heard about Waterloo from my optometrist. He graduated from the Waterloo's school of optometry, and had a picture of his graduating class hung up on the wall of his office. I didn't know how the school was, nor did I really care at first. I don't remember exactly how I started developing an interest in attending Waterloo but it must have happened in grade 12. I think I first heard from some people that it had a really good computer science program. I took an introductory course in Java in grade 12 so I had somewhat of a background in programming already. This, along with the fact that my dad is an SWE, influenced me to apply for the SE and CS program at Waterloo. I applied just for fun and to see if I could get in. I barely did any research on the university or any of its programs.

A few months later, I received an email in late February stating that I was accepted into the SE program. I was happy, but definitely not overjoyed or anything. After all, I've been set on going to UBC for Sciences for so long. What could possibly change this long held belief, with merely a term of highschool left?

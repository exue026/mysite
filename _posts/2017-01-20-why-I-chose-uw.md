As just your average kid who grew up in Vancity, I had pretty decent Canadian schools nearby like SFU and UBC, both of which are ranked top 10 in the nation, so why did I decide to take my (non-existing) talents to the University of Waterloo, an institution basically located in the middle of nowhere?? There's a long story to it.

Before grade 12, I barely knew about Waterloo. I vaguely remember having a conversation about Canadian Universities with my parents when I was small. I recall sitting on the couch in our old apartment one evening, while my parents were reading the newspaper. Specifically, they were analyzing an article about the top ranking schools in Canada. That's when I learned about McGill, which was listed as first place in that article, as well as other schools like Queens and UBC. I remember my mom saying that UBC was very hard to be accepted into, had a good medical school, and was near our city. I don't remember the exact details after that, but ever since then I somehow attained the belief that UBC was "the school" I was going to attend, I was going to be a doctor, and the road wouldn't be easy. Funny enough, looking back many years later, UBC is not "the school" I'm currently at, and I am not planning to be a doctor, but what did turn out to be true is that the road has not, and will not be easy.
